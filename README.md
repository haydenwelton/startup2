# HTML website

Basic HTML website to serve as the main view of your work in the course.





Over the course of using CSS and HTML in this class, I learned during my startup pboject how to use rows and columns really well. I wasn't the best at them at first, but now I feel a lot more confident. Also, I learned that web design is hard work!
